This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game inspired (not copied) by the
[React Official Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) with some
enhancements.

The purpose of the project was to learn the basic principles of developing a
React application.

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
